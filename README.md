**Custom Make Command in Linux**
This project is a custom implementation of the make command using Linux system programming. It automates the build process by checking file dependencies, comparing timestamps, and executing commands when dependencies are updated.

**Features:**
1) Dynamic dependency management
2) Automatic command execution for out-of-date targets
3) Efficient file handling using stat() system call
4) Error handling for missing files
This project enhances understanding of system-level programming in C, focusing on file I/O and build automation.
